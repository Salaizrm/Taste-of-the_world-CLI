Plans and Structure:

1. CLI
  - finish CLI

2. Scraper
  - keep scraper simple. Let Recipes handle most of code

RECORD THIS PART(30 minutes)
3. Recipes class
  -

4. test and clean code
    - Remember to write description and summary in gemspec.
    - Remember to write how to start app in README.

5. Be ready to explain everything involved with code, the how and why.

Where I left off:
Close to finishing first part that grabs cuisines and list them.
Cant run program, error is saying taste-of-the-world-CLI/lib/taste_of_the_world/scraper.rb:1:in `<top (required)>': uninitialized constant TasteOfTheWorld (NameError).
need to schedule one on one or join zoom class.
