Plans and Structure:

1. CLI
  - finish CLI

2. Scraper
  - keep scraper simple. Let Recipes handle most of code

RECORD THIS PART(30 minutes)
3. Recipes class
  -

4. test and clean code
    - Remember to write description and summary in gemspec.
    - Remember to write how to start app in README.

5. Be ready to explain everything involved with code, the how and why.

Where I left off:
OKAY. Need to just focus on scraping full recipe then being able to select it from "style". I only need one to work so harcode, category and style to lead to recipe list.

#choose category => choose style => choose recipe => full recipe(PRIORITY)

#hard code menus
#store urls into hashes

"#{"k"=}, v"
